Written assessment Post Doctorial Fellow â€“ Agroclimatic & Crop Modeling
Overview
This assignment focuses on climate data analysis, spatial modeling, and crop modeling by analyzing gridded datasets, process climate data using a dataset from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CHEPOL containing information about different crops production area from 1947 to 2014 in India. 
Data Loading: The first step is to load the dataset containing information about crops, states, seasons, crop years, and production quantities.

Missing Value Imputation: Next, the dataset is examined to identify any missing values. Missing values are handled by employing suitable imputation techniques to ensure the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.

Data Exploration and Visualization: The dataset is explored to gain insights into the crops, states, seasons, and production quantities. Visualizations are created to depict the distribution of crop production, identify the most commonly grown crops in each state, analyze production trends over the years, and determine the highest production by season.

Answering Analytical Questions: Several analytical questions are addressed using the dataset. These questions include identifying the most commonly grown crops in each state, examining the highest crop production by season, identifying crops that consistently perform well across different seasons, determining the states with the highest production throughout the whole year, identifying the states with the highest production in each season, analyzing the distribution of crop production across different seasons, and determining the year with the highest overall production.
