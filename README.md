Written assessment Post Doctorial Fellow – Agroclimatic & Crop Modeling
Overview
This assignment focuses on climate data analysis, spatial modeling, and crop modeling by analyzing gridded datasets, process climate data using a dataset from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CHEPOL containing information about different crops production area from 1947 to 2014 in India. 
Data Loading: The first step is to load the dataset containing information about crops, states, seasons, crop years, and production quantities.
1. Data Exploration 
2.	Climate Hazard Indicator:
The climate hazard indicator that I think best represents the climate’s impact on crop production is the consecutive dry days (depending on the number of consecutive dry days: 3, 10, etc.).
Select a climate dataset that has spatial and temporal overlap with the production dataset. You may use freely available datasets (e.g., from NOAA, CHIRPS, or other platforms).
•	Calculate the climate hazard indicator for each sub-national region and year. Document your process for creating this indicator.
